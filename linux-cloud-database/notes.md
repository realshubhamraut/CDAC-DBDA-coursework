# üåê Advanced SSH & Remote Access Commands

This section expands on the basics of remote access, focusing on the powerful features of SSH for secure and efficient remote administration.

---

## üîë SSH Key Management & Passwordless Login

Using SSH keys is more secure and convenient than using passwords. The basic idea is to create a **private key** (which you keep secret on your computer) and a **public key** (which you place on the servers you want to connect to).

* **`ssh-keygen`**: Generates a new SSH key pair.
    * **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`**: Creates a modern and secure `ed25519` key. You'll be prompted to save the key and set an optional passphrase for extra security.
* **`ssh-copy-id user@host`**: The easiest and most recommended way to install your public key on a remote server. It automatically appends your key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote machine with the correct permissions.
* **`ssh-agent`**: A background program that holds your private keys in memory. You "unlock" your key once with its passphrase, and the agent provides it to SSH sessions automatically.
    * **`eval $(ssh-agent -s)`**: Starts the agent for your current shell session.
* **`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`**: Adds your private key to the `ssh-agent`. If you set a passphrase, you'll be prompted to enter it here. After this, you can SSH to any server with your public key without a password or passphrase for the rest of your session.

---

## üöÄ Advanced SSH Usage & Tunneling

SSH can do much more than just give you a shell. It can securely tunnel network traffic.

* **`ssh user@host 'command'`**: Executes a single command on the remote server without starting an interactive shell.
    * *Example*: `ssh admin@webserver 'sudo systemctl restart nginx'`
* **Local Port Forwarding (`-L`)**: Maps a port on your **local machine** to a port on a **remote server**. This is great for securely accessing a remote database or web service that isn't exposed to the internet.
    * *Example*: `ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@remoteserver` ‚Äî Now, visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your local browser will securely connect you to the web server running on port 80 on the `remoteserver`.
* **Remote Port Forwarding (`-R`)**: Maps a port on the **remote server** to a port on your **local machine**. This is useful for temporarily exposing a local development server to the internet through a remote machine.
    * *Example*: `ssh -R 8080:localhost:3000 user@remoteserver` ‚Äî Anyone visiting `http://remoteserver:8080` will be connected to your local application running on port 3000.
* **Dynamic Port Forwarding / SOCKS Proxy (`-D`)**: Turns the SSH connection into a SOCKS proxy. You can configure your web browser or other applications to route their traffic through this proxy, securely tunneling all your browsing through the remote server.
    * *Example*: `ssh -D 8080 user@remoteserver`
* **SSH Config File (`~/.ssh/config`)**: A configuration file to create shortcuts and aliases for your SSH connections. This is incredibly useful for managing multiple servers.
    ```
    # Example entry in ~/.ssh/config
    Host webserver
        HostName 192.168.1.100
        User admin
        Port 2222
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_webserver
    ```
    With the above config, you can simply type `ssh webserver` instead of the long command.

---

## üìÇ Advanced File Transfers

While `scp` is simple, `sftp` and `rsync` offer more power and flexibility.

* **`sftp user@host`**: Starts an interactive **S**ecure **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol session. It works like a traditional FTP client but runs over the secure SSH protocol. Inside the `sftp` prompt, you can use commands like:
    * **`ls` / `lls`**: List remote / local files.
    * **`cd` / `lcd`**: Change remote / local directory.
    * **`get remote-file`**: Download a file from the server.
    * **`put local-file`**: Upload a file to the server.
* **`rsync` (Advanced Flags)**:
    * **`--delete`**: Deletes files on the destination if they no longer exist at the source. This is used for creating an exact mirror.
    * **`--exclude='*.log'`**: Excludes files matching a certain pattern.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Persistent Remote Sessions (Terminal Multiplexers)

What happens if your internet connection drops during a long remote task? A terminal multiplexer saves your session so you can reconnect later without losing your work.

* **`screen`**: The original terminal multiplexer.
    * **`screen`**: Start a new screen session.
    * **`Ctrl+a` then `d`**: **D**etach from the current session (it keeps running in the background).
    * **`screen -r`**: **R**e-attach to a detached session.
* **`tmux`**: A modern and more popular alternative to `screen`. It has better support for splitting the terminal into multiple panes and managing multiple windows.
    * **`tmux new -s my_session`**: Start a new named session.
    * **`Ctrl+b` then `d`**: **D**etach from the current session.
    * **`tmux attach -t my_session`**: **A**ttach to a named session.

---

## üì± Alternative Remote Shells

* **`mosh`**: The **Mo**bile **Sh**ell. An alternative to SSH that is designed for unstable or high-latency connections (like mobile or Wi-Fi). It allows you to roam between networks and keeps your session alive even if your connection drops temporarily. It requires `mosh` to be installed on both the client and the server.
